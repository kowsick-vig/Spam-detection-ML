The Council is made of nine financial regulatory agency Inspectors General and is chaired by Chris Thorson, Inspector General, U.S. Department of Treasury.
 
 
 
 
We have taken time to review unsuccessful transactions with most international inheritance/contract insurance companies and other foreign banks especially in Africa, Asia and the United Kingdom. We wish to let you know we have communicated with most of these foreign banking institutions withholding most international payments to individuals and companies so as to find out why these funds were withheld, the source of the funds and a final solution to these problems.
 
 
 
 
Conclusively, we discovered most withheld and unpaid funds originating from lottery organizations, international trading, companies' awarded contract funds and deceased persons were not properly filed for payment to its intended beneficiaries.
 
 
 
Transfer suspension was placed on these funds because the majority of these international funds remittance/transfer were not properly recorded by the paying institution for future file reference/assessment by the International Monetary Fund and the Financial Services Authority.
 
 
 
 
In joint alliance with the Financial Services Authority to resolve this issue, we wish to let you know we have been approved to assist you in receiving your awarded funds, the total sum of $1,250,000 (One Million Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars). We have gone through the security records of all international outstanding transactions and our extensive investigation confirmed you are the beneficiary through the assistance of the International Criminal Police Organization (ICPO). We have obtained an Approval Authorization Letter from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which states that your funds will be paid to you on proper confirmation of your claim.
 
 
 
We wish to inform you that there is an existing arrangement with United Nations Federal Credit Union ( UNFCU ) to process and pay you the sum of $1,250,000 USD as soon as you provide the complete requirements needed for them to process your fund payment case. This was resolved in a meeting held between the International Financial Auditors in Europe and our Asians representatives.
