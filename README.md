# üìß Spam Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to build a **Spam Detection System** using multiple **Machine Learning models**. It classifies messages as either **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)** based on text features. The models are trained and evaluated using a combination of different datasets and vectorization techniques to maximize accuracy and performance.

## üìã Project Overview

In this project:

* We **trained, tested, and compared** several Machine Learning algorithms for the spam classification task.
* **TF-IDF Vectorizer** was used to transform the raw text data into numerical features.
* Models were trained and saved as `.pkl` files for easy deployment in any production environment.

Would you also like me to give a small **"How to Run"** guide if someone wants to use your `.pkl` models easily? üöÄ
(Example: how to load `svm_model.pkl` and `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl` and predict spam?)
I can add that if you want!
